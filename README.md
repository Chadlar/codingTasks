# *Exploratory Data Analysis*

## Description
  In this task, we are doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) research using the 'Titanic.csv' dataset. Delve into this dataset and infer significant informations in the notebook.  
  EDA is a critical step in the data science process that ensures the quality and integrity of your data analysis, leading to more informed and effective decision-making.

## Installation
To set up your local environment to run this EDA project, follow these steps.
### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install Jupyter Notebook. You can do this by running:
```python
pip install notebook
```
- Additionally, you need to have the following Python libraries to use the code:
1. [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) 
```python
pip install numpy
```
2. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
```python
pip install pandas
```
3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
```python
pip install matplotlib
```
4. [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)   
Seaborn requires an installation of Python 3.8 or greater.
```python
pip install seaborn
```
5. [missingno](https://pypi.org/project/missingno/)
```python
pip install missingno
```
- You can use Conda for run the Jupyter notebook as well or
- If you don't want to use any source-code editor you can try [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try) on your browser


## Usage 
Once you have installed all prerequisites and dependencies, you can start analyzing the data.
1. First download Titanic.csv dataset and titanic.ipynb jupyter notebook and be sure they are in the same path.
2.
